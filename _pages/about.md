# ðŸ‘‹ Hello there, I'm Lam

I am a Ph.D. student at the Faculty of Information Technology, Monash University. I received both my Master's and Bachelor's degrees from the University of Engineering and Technology, Vietnam National University, under the supervision of A/Prof. Pham Ngoc Hung.

My research centres on the security and quality assurance of software systems, with a particular emphasis on software testing and automated repair. I am especially interested in the trustworthiness of intelligent software engineering tools. My work involves developing and applying novel techniques in artificial intelligence and program analysis to support these goals.
