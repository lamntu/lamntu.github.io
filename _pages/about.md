I began my Ph.D in Software Engineering (SE) at Monash University in 2024, under the supervision of Prof. [Aldeida Aleti](https://research.monash.edu/en/persons/aldeida-aleti), Dr. [Xiaoning Du](https://xiaoningdu.github.io/), and Dr. [Neelofar](https://www.rmit.edu.au/profiles/n/neelofar-neelofar). 
Before that, I received both my Master's and Bachelor's degrees from the University of Engineering and Technology, Vietnam National University, under the supervision of A/Prof. [Pham Ngoc Hung](https://uet.vnu.edu.vn/~hungpn/).

Key expertises and research interests:
- **Trustworthy Artificial Intelligence & Testing**
    - I focus on developing trustworthy AI-based software systems and testing their trustworthiness.
    - I am especially interested in testing the trustworthiness of AI-based tools for coding tasks, ensuring they provide explainable outputs aligning with SE standards.
- **Traditional Software Testing**
    - I also have experience in automated test data generation and code change analysis, particularly in concolic testing, static analysis, and dynamic analysis.
    - From 2018 to 2024, I led a team of 8 ‚Äì 10 undergraduate students in collaboration with [FPT Software Ltd.](https://fptsoftware.com/) and [Viettel Group](https://viettel.com.vn/en/). These projects aim to automate unit testing for C/C++ embedded software, detect the logical impact of code changes on system behaviour, and streamline regression testing.
